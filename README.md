# MMAWorkoutTracker

This project will serve as my introduction to backend development.


PLAN: This will be a Workout Tracker Web App that allows users—like MMA athletes and hobbyists—to log, track, and analyze their training sessions across several disciplines such as strength training, wrestling, Jiu Jitsu, Muay Thai, Judo and various other facets of martial arts. It'll have a backend built with Node.js and Express, a MongoDB database for storing workouts, and a REST API that enables users to track their progress over time. The goal of this project is to give myself, the creator, a solid introduction to backend development, authentication (JWT), and working with databases. Once the core features are built, I plan to refine it and integrate a simple frontend for usability.
